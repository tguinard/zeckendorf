Interesting thing I found while mucking around.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem

What I have plotted is the distribution of the number of terms in a Zeckendorf representation for integers below a certain value.

zeck.py plots all distributions where the maximum value is 10**n for all integers up to some maximum n.
